1. Introduction:<br>
                <br>A:Over the past few decades, the US has poured billions of dollars into building more highways. 
                <br>B: The logic behind this was that by increasing capacity, we could reduce traffic congestion. 
                <br>C: But in reality, highways make traffic worse. 
                <br>D: Here's how: 
                <br>
                <br>2. The Problem: 
                <br>A: More lanes mean more cars, which means more traffic. 
                <br>B: This is because of something called "induced demand." 
                <br>C: When you build more lanes, people will drive more. It's simple economics. 
                <br>D: The more you build, the more people will use it. 
                <br>
                <br>3. The Solution: 
                <br>A: The solution is to stop building more highways. 
                <br>B: We need to invest in other forms of transportation, like public transit, biking, and walking. 
                <br>C: We also need to invest in land-use planning, so that we can build cities that are more dense and walkable. 
                <br>D: This will lead to less traffic and more livable cities. 
                <br>
                <br>4. Conclusion: 
                <br>A: We need to stop building more highways if we want to solve the traffic problem. 
                <br>B: We need to invest in other forms of transportation, and in land-use planning. 
                <br>C: This will lead to less traffic and more livable cities.














				
                1. The Problem:
                <br>
                <br>A: The world is running out of sand. 
                <br>B: The world uses more sand than it can replace. 
                <br>C: The world uses sand for construction, industry, and recreation. 
                <br>D: The demand for sand is increasing. 
                <br>E: The supply of sand is decreasing. 
                <br>F: The price of sand is increasing. 
                <br>G: The sand crisis is affecting the economy. 
                <br>H: The sand crisis is affecting the environment.
                <br>
                <br>2. The Solution:
                <br>
                <br>A: The world needs to find a way to recycle sand. 
                <br>B: The world needs to find a way to reuse sand. 
                <br>C: The world needs to find a way to reduce the demand for sand. 
                <br>D: The world needs to find a way to stop the desertification of the Sahara and the Gobi deserts. 
                <br>E: The world needs to find a way to stop the expansion of the Sahara and the Gobi deserts.
                <br>
                <br>  3. Research:
                <br>
                <br> A: The Sahara desert was once a green and fertile land. 
                <br> B: The Sahara is now the world's largest desert. 
                <br> C: The Sahara desert is expanding. 
                <br> D: The Sahara desert is expanding because of a process called desertification. 
                <br> E: Desertification is caused by a combination of factors, including climate change, overgrazing, and unsustainable farming practices. 
                <br> F: The Sahara desert is not the only desert that is expanding. 
                <br> G: The Gobi desert is also expanding. 
                <br> H: The expansion of the Sahara and the Gobi deserts is causing a decrease in the world's supply of sand.
                <br>
                <br> 4. Conclusion:
                <br>
                <br> A: The world is running out of sand and the world needs to find a way to reduce the demand for sand. 
                <br>  B: The world can reduce the demand for sand by recycling sand, reusing sand, and reducing the demand for sand. 
                <br>  C: The world can stop the desertification of the Sahara and the Gobi deserts by finding a way to stop the expansion of the Sahara and the Gobi deserts.
